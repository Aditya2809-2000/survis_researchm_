# SurVis - Visual Literature Browser

SurVis is a flexible online browser to present and analyze scientific literature. The system targets all authors of survey articles, theses, or books who want to share their references in a very accessible way. All you need to start is a bib file and a list of keywords for your papers.

SurVis reference literature database:

* Dynamic Graph Visualization - http://dynamicgraphs.fbeck.com
 
Other literature databases using SurVis:

* Performance Visualization - http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~ki/STAR/
* Visualization for Software Reuse - http://www.cos.ufrj.br/~schots/survis_reuse/

Currently, the system is distributed on request only. Please contact fabian.beck@visus.uni-stuttgart.de if you are interested. A first public release of the code is planned for late October 2014.
